Research current Neovim distributions (2024-2025) focusing on:

- Command palette implementations
- Fuzzy finders for large codebases
- Minimal configuration requirements
- Exploration-focused workflows

User needs: command palette, robust fuzzy finder, visual search, batteries-included.
Already aware of: AstroVim, LazyVim, NvChad.
Use case: tmux + nvim for code exploration, no LSP needed.

## Research completed

Comprehensive research document created covering:

- Major Neovim distributions (AstroNvim, LazyVim, NvChad, LunarVim, Ecovim, kickstart.nvim)
- Command palette implementations (legendary.nvim, which-key.nvim)
- Fuzzy finder alternatives (Snacks Picker, fzf-lua vs telescope.nvim)
- Performance considerations for large codebases
- Additional navigation tools (flash.nvim, neo-tree, nvim-spectre, barbecue.nvim)
