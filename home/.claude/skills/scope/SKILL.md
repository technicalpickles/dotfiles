# Scope - Developer Environment Management

Scope is a DevEx tool that helps maintain consistent development environments through automated checks, error detection, and fixes.

## Core Commands

### scope doctor

Run automated environment checks and fixes.

```bash
scope doctor run                   # Run all checks
scope doctor run --only group-name # Run specific group
scope doctor run --fix=false       # Check only, no fixes
scope doctor run --no-cache        # Disable caching
scope doctor list                  # List available checks
```

### scope analyze

Detect known errors in logs or command output.

```bash
scope analyze logs file.log                # Analyze log file
scope analyze command -- cmd args          # Analyze command output
scope analyze --extra-config path file.log # Use additional configs
```

### scope report

Generate bug reports with automatic secret redaction.

```bash
scope report ./script.sh     # Run and report on script
scope report -- command args # Run and report on command
```

### scope-intercept

Monitor script execution in real-time (used as shebang).

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env scope-intercept bash
# Script content here
```

## Configuration Resources

All Scope configurations use Kubernetes-inspired YAML format:

```yaml
apiVersion: scope.github.com/v1alpha
kind: <ResourceType>
metadata:
  name: unique-identifier
  description: Human-readable description
spec:
  # Resource-specific configuration
```

## ScopeKnownError

Define error patterns and provide automated help/fixes for common issues.

### Structure

```yaml
apiVersion: scope.github.com/v1alpha
kind: ScopeKnownError
metadata:
  name: descriptive-error-name
  description: Brief description of what this error means
spec:
  pattern: 'regex pattern to match the error'
  help: |
    Clear explanation of the issue.

    Steps to resolve:
    1. First step
    2. Second step
    3. Where to get help if needed
  fix:
    prompt:
      text: User-friendly prompt asking permission
    commands:
      - first-fix-command
      - second-fix-command
```

### Key Fields

- **pattern**: Regex pattern using ripgrep syntax to match error text
- **help**: Multi-line markdown explanation with resolution steps
- **fix** (optional): Automated remediation with user prompt and commands

### File Organization

Place files in categorized directories:

- Location: `{config-root}/known-errors/{category}/{error-name}.yaml`
- Common categories: `docker/`, `ruby/`, `git/`, `github/`, `mysql/`, `postgres/`, `dns/`, `aws/`
- Include matching `.txt` file with example error for testing

### Example

```yaml
apiVersion: scope.github.com/v1alpha
kind: ScopeKnownError
metadata:
  name: gem-missing-file
  description: A gem source file is missing and fails to be loaded
spec:
  pattern: "/lib/ruby/.* `require': cannot load such file --.*/lib/ruby/gems/.*(LoadError)"
  help: |
    A gem source file is missing. The solution is to reinstall the gems:
    1. Run `bundle pristine`
  fix:
    prompt:
      text: Run bundle pristine?
    commands:
      - bundle pristine
```

### Validation

Validate schema structure:

```bash
brew install sourcemeta/apps/jsonschema
jsonschema validate schema.json known-error.yaml
```

Test pattern matching:

```bash
scope analyze logs --extra-config config-dir/ test-error.txt
```

### Pattern Writing Tips

- Use ripgrep regex syntax (similar to PCRE)
- Escape special characters: `\\.`, `\\[`, `\\(`
- Use character classes: `[[:digit:]]`, `[[:alpha:]]`
- Test patterns: `echo "error text" | rg "pattern"`
- Balance specificity vs flexibility to avoid false positives/negatives

## ScopeDoctorGroup

Define environment setup and maintenance checks with automated fixes.

### Structure

```yaml
apiVersion: scope.github.com/v1alpha
kind: ScopeDoctorGroup
metadata:
  name: tool-name
  description: Brief description of what this group does
spec:
  include: when-required # or "by-default"
  needs:
    - dependency-1
    - dependency-2
  actions:
    - name: action-name
      description: What this action checks/fixes
      required: true # default true; false for optional checks
      check:
        paths:
          - 'file-to-watch.txt'
          - '**/*.config'
        commands:
          - ./bin/check-script.sh
      fix:
        commands:
          - ./bin/fix-script.sh
        helpText: |
          What to do if the fix fails.
          Where to get help.
        helpUrl: https://docs.example.com/help
```

### Key Components

#### Include Modes

- **by-default**: Always runs with `scope doctor run`
- **when-required**: Only runs when explicitly specified or as dependency

#### Dependencies

List other groups that must run first in `needs` array. Creates execution graph.

#### Actions

Each action is an atomic check/fix operation that runs in order.

#### Check Logic

Determines if fix should run. Fix runs when:

- **No check defined**: Fix always runs
- **paths specified**: Any file changed or no files match globs
- **commands specified**: Any command exits non-zero
- Both can be combined (OR logic)

#### Fix Section

- **commands**: List of commands to run in order
- **helpText**: Shown if fix fails (markdown supported)
- **helpUrl**: Optional link to documentation

### File Organization

- Application setup: `{config-root}/application/`
- Environment setup: `{config-root}/environment/`
- Project-specific: `.scope/` in project root

### Example

```yaml
apiVersion: scope.github.com/v1alpha
kind: ScopeDoctorGroup
metadata:
  name: ruby-version
  description: Set up Ruby with correct version
spec:
  include: when-required
  needs:
    - ruby-manager
    - homebrew
  actions:
    - name: install
      description: Ensures correct version of ruby is installed
      check:
        paths:
          - '{{ working_dir }}/.ruby-version'
        commands:
          - ./bin/ruby-version.sh verify
      fix:
        commands:
          - ./bin/ruby-version.sh install
        helpText: |
          Ruby installation failed.
          Contact: #help-channel
```

### Script Conventions

Create helper scripts following check/fix pattern:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

ACTION="${1:-check}"

check() {
  # Return 0 if check passes, non-zero if fix needed
  if [[ condition ]]; then
    echo "Check passed"
    return 0
  else
    echo "Check failed" >&2
    return 1
  fi
}

fix() {
  # Perform fix, return 0 on success
  echo "Running fix..."
  # Fix commands here
  return 0
}

case "$ACTION" in
  check) check ;;
  fix) fix ;;
  *)
    echo "Usage: $0 [check|fix]" >&2
    exit 1
    ;;
esac
```

Script best practices:

- Use relative paths with `./` prefix (relative to YAML file)
- Make scripts idempotent (safe to run multiple times)
- Exit 0 for success, non-zero for failure
- Write errors to stderr
- Include helpful error messages

### Caching

File-based checks use content hashing:

- Cache stores file path and content hash
- Only re-runs if file contents change
- Persists between runs
- Disable with `--no-cache`

## ScopeReportLocation

Configure where and how bug reports are uploaded.

### GitHub Issues

```yaml
apiVersion: scope.github.com/v1alpha
kind: ScopeReportLocation
metadata:
  name: github
spec:
  destination:
    githubIssue:
      owner: org-name
      repo: repo-name
  additionalData:
    nodeVersion: node -v
    rubyPath: which ruby
```

Authentication via environment variables:

- GitHub App: `SCOPE_GH_APP_ID` + `SCOPE_GH_APP_KEY`
- Personal Access Token: `SCOPE_GH_TOKEN`

### Local File System

```yaml
apiVersion: scope.github.com/v1alpha
kind: ScopeReportLocation
metadata:
  name: local
spec:
  destination:
    local:
      directory: /tmp/scope-reports
  additionalData:
    pwd: pwd
    username: id -un
    scopeVersion: scope version
```

### RustyPaste

```yaml
apiVersion: scope.github.com/v1alpha
kind: ScopeReportLocation
metadata:
  name: rustypaste
spec:
  destination:
    rustyPaste:
      url: http://localhost:8000
```

### Additional Data

Capture environment context with arbitrary commands:

```yaml
additionalData:
  diskSpace: df -h
  gitBranch: git branch --show-current
  envVars: env | sort
```

Commands execute at report generation time. Scope automatically redacts secrets.

## Common Patterns

### Version Check Pattern

```yaml
actions:
  - name: minimum-version
    description: Ensure minimum version installed
    check:
      commands:
        - ./bin/check-version.sh check tool 1.2.3
    fix:
      helpText: |
        You don't have the minimum version installed.
        Check Managed Software Center for updates.
```

### File-Based Check Pattern

```yaml
actions:
  - name: config-file
    description: Verify config file exists and is valid
    check:
      paths:
        - .config-file
      commands:
        - test -s .config-file
    fix:
      commands:
        - ./bin/setup-config.sh
```

### Service Health Pattern

```yaml
actions:
  - name: service-running
    description: Ensure service is running
    check:
      commands:
        - ./bin/check-service.sh
    fix:
      commands:
        - ./bin/start-service.sh
      helpText: |
        Service failed to start.
        Check logs: tail "$(brew --prefix)/var/log/service.log"
```

### Dependency Install Pattern

```yaml
actions:
  - name: install-packages
    description: Install project dependencies
    check:
      paths:
        - package.json
        - yarn.lock
    fix:
      commands:
        - yarn install
```

### Orchestration Pattern

```yaml
# Main group that just coordinates dependencies
spec:
  needs:
    - environment-setup
    - database-setup
    - language-runtime
  actions: [] # No actions, just orchestration
```

## Workflow: Creating Known Error

1. **Identify error pattern**

   - Capture actual error output
   - Find unique identifying text
   - Create regex pattern

2. **Create files**

   ```bash
   mkdir -p {config-root}/known-errors/category
   touch {config-root}/known-errors/category/error-name.yaml
   touch {config-root}/known-errors/category/error-name.txt
   ```

3. **Write YAML definition**

   - Use template structure
   - Write clear help text with numbered steps
   - Add fix commands if automation is possible

4. **Create test file**

   - Put actual error output in `.txt` file
   - Include enough context for pattern matching

5. **Test pattern**

   ```bash
   scope analyze logs \
     --extra-config {config-root} \
     {config-root}/known-errors/category/error-name.txt
   ```

6. **Validate schema**
   ```bash
   jsonschema validate schema.json error-name.yaml
   ```

## Workflow: Creating Doctor Group

1. **Define problem domain**

   - What needs checking/fixing?
   - What are the dependencies?
   - Application or environment level?

2. **Create group file**

   ```bash
   # Application-level
   touch {config-root}/application/tool.yaml
   
   # Environment-level
   touch {config-root}/environment/tool.yaml
   
   # Project-specific
   touch .scope/tool.yaml
   ```

3. **Create helper scripts**

   ```bash
   mkdir -p .scope/bin
   touch .scope/bin/tool.sh
   chmod +x .scope/bin/tool.sh
   ```

4. **Write group definition**

   - Define metadata (name, description)
   - List dependencies in `needs`
   - Create actions for each discrete check
   - Reference scripts with relative paths

5. **Test the group**

   ```bash
   scope doctor list                       # Verify detected
   scope doctor run --only tool            # Test execution
   scope doctor run --only tool --no-cache # Test without cache
   ```

6. **Add to parent group**
   Update parent group's `needs` list if this is a new dependency

## Debugging

### Known Error Not Matching

- Test regex: `rg "pattern" test-file.txt`
- Check special character escaping
- Verify pattern exists in test file
- Use `scope analyze logs --extra-config` with test file

### Doctor Check Always Running

- Verify `paths` globs match files
- Check commands exit 0 on success
- Try `--no-cache` to rule out caching
- Verify script permissions (executable)

### Dependency Issues

- Run `scope doctor list` to see execution order
- Verify all `needs` items exist
- Check for circular dependencies
- Use `--only` to test individual groups

### Script Path Issues

- Use `./` prefix for relative paths (relative to YAML)
- Ensure scripts have execute permissions
- Use absolute paths or PATH for system commands
- Verify working directory

## Security Features

### Automatic Redaction

Scope automatically redacts sensitive information:

- GitHub API tokens
- AWS credentials
- SSH keys
- Environment variable values containing secrets
- Uses patterns from [ripsecrets](https://github.com/sirwart/ripsecrets)

This makes it safe to capture full environment in reports and share debug output publicly.
