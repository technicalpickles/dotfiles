# 2. Rename to dotfiles

Date: 2021-11-28

## Status

Accepted

## Context

This repository was originally named `dotpickles` to be cute.

[Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) will automatically pull down a `dotfiles`repo for you.

Strap will automatically pull down a `dotfiles` while setting up your machine.

## Decision

Rename repository to dotfiles to match convention for strap and codespaces.

## Consequences

Existing checkouts will continue to work because of GitHub repository redirects.

One step closer to Codespaces support.
