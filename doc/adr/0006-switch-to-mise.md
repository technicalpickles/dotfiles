# 6. Switch to mise

Date: 2025-08-11

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Previously, I was using asdf for my own machines and a combination of rbenv and nodenv for work.

Work has since standardized on mise, which can be thought of as an evolution of asdf.

## Decision

Switch personal setup to mise for consistency.

## Consequence

Work manages a lot of the environment, so we still need to split between personal and work. It is the same underlying version manager though.
