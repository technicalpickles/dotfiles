# LaunchAgent Test Results

**Date:** October 9, 2025
**Agent:** `com.technicalpickles.disable-spotlight`

## Test Summary: ✅ ALL TESTS PASSED

### 1. ✅ Symlink Creation

```bash
$ ln -sf "$PWD/LaunchAgents/com.technicalpickles.disable-spotlight.plist" \
  "$HOME/Library/LaunchAgents/com.technicalpickles.disable-spotlight.plist"
```

**Result:** Symlink created successfully

- Links to: `/Users/josh.nichols/workspace/dotfiles/LaunchAgents/com.technicalpickles.disable-spotlight.plist`

### 2. ✅ Plist Validation

```bash
$ ./launchagents.sh validate com.technicalpickles.disable-spotlight
```

**Result:** Plist syntax is valid

### 3. ✅ Command Test

```bash
$ ./LaunchAgents/test-spotlight-disable.sh
```

**Result:** Command works correctly

- All volumes show: `Indexing disabled.`
- Volumes tested:
  - `/`
  - `/System/Volumes/Data`
  - `/System/Volumes/Preboot`

### 4. ✅ LaunchAgent Load

```bash
$ ./launchagents.sh load com.technicalpickles.disable-spotlight
```

**Result:** Agent loaded successfully

- PID: `-` (ran and exited, as expected for one-time command)
- Status: `0` (success)
- Agent is properly loaded in launchd

### 5. ✅ Status Check

```bash
$ ./launchagents.sh status com.technicalpickles.disable-spotlight
```

**Result:** Agent is loaded and healthy

- Shows as loaded in `launchctl list`
- Exit status: 0 (success)

### 6. ✅ Logs Check

```bash
$ ./launchagents.sh logs com.technicalpickles.disable-spotlight
```

**Result:** Agent executed without errors

- System logs show agent was loaded by backgroundtaskmanagementd
- Agent ran and went inactive (correct behavior)
- No error messages in stderr

### 7. ✅ Spotlight Status Verification

```bash
$ sudo mdutil -a -s
```

**Result:** Spotlight is disabled on all volumes

```
/:
        Indexing disabled.
/System/Volumes/Data:
        Indexing disabled.
/System/Volumes/Preboot:
        Indexing disabled.
```

### 8. ✅ Agent Listing

```bash
$ ./launchagents.sh list
```

**Result:** Agent appears in list with loaded indicator (●)

- Properly identified as managed by dotfiles (symlink shown)

## Conclusions

✅ **The LaunchAgent is working correctly!**

- Plist syntax is valid
- Command executes without errors
- Agent loads successfully
- Spotlight is disabled as expected
- Logging is working
- Status tracking works

## Next Steps

The LaunchAgent is ready for production use. It will automatically run at login to disable Spotlight indexing.

### To Test After Reboot:

1. Reboot your machine
2. After login, check status:
   ```bash
   sudo mdutil -a -s
   ./launchagents.sh status com.technicalpickles.disable-spotlight
   ./launchagents.sh logs com.technicalpickles.disable-spotlight
   ```

### To Unload (if needed):

```bash
./launchagents.sh unload com.technicalpickles.disable-spotlight
```

### To Re-enable Spotlight:

```bash
sudo mdutil -a -i on
```

## Notes

- Agent successfully runs with sudo (no password prompt issues)
- One-time execution model works correctly (doesn't stay resident)
- Logging to system logs is functioning
- Helper script (`launchagents.sh`) works perfectly for management
